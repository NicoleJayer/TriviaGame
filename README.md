# TriviaGame

This trivia game was designed to be a timed question and answer project that
utilizes a blend of javascript and jquery with a theme of whatever we choose.

I have decided to give the player a minute per question, while the game changes Disney backgrounds
based on the question and keeps track of the correct and wrong answers in the background, revealing
them after the player has completed 5 rounds.

I chose a Disney movie theme since I am familiar with the topic. Below are the questions
and answers that I feature in this game.
